# DGA Detection

# Model Overview

## Description:
* This model is a recurrent neural network model trained to classify URL domains generated by Domain-Generation-Algorithms. Domain generation algorithms (DGA) are algorithms seen in various families of malware that are used to periodically generate a large number of domain names that can be used as rendezvous points with their command and control servers. The large number of potential rendezvous points makes it difficult for law enforcement to effectively shut down botnets, since infected computers will attempt to contact some of these domain names every day to receive updates or commands. <br>

## Requirements:

* To run this example, additional requirements must be installed into your environment. A supplementary requirements file has been provided in this example directory.
